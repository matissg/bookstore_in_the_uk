## On-Page SEO
### Keywords 
 - Pick 3-5 keywords that describe content well, for example, *crime thriller books, romance books, UK best-selling books*

 - In body text use variations and synonyms too
 - Not focusing on keyword density but content quality (for people!)
### Title tags

 - unique, describe the content, with main keywords included
 - in length 50-60 characters
 For example, *"Crime, Mystery and Thriller Books - New Bookstore"*

 - visible in search results under the title tag
 - unique, explain the content of the page
 - recommended length 50-160 characters

### Headers
