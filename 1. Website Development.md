## 1. Website Development
The bookstore company does not have internal software engineering and DevOps teams, and needs to go live fast so it is decided to build [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/ie/blog/what-is-shopify) store (with custom domain name) for the bookstore in the UK purposes. Shopify is one of the most powerful and complete commerce platforms and is capable of handling millions of items and customers. [Shopify plan](https://www.shopify.com/pricing) would be selected for â‚¬828/annually.

Expected technical capability characteristics of the bookstore website:
 - at least 10k inventory items
 - at least 100k visitors monthly traffic
 - performance score at least 90%
 - first content paint under 1 second
 - mandatory mobile view
 - multiple language support, however for the initial stage English only is required

### Responsive Design
[Stockmart Shopify theme](https://proquotient.com/shopify/stockmart-theme/) ([see preview here](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/stockmart/styles/modern/preview)) or similar is suggested to address given technical capabilities must be used. Although Shopify does the most of heavy lifting regarding fast page load times, the website must be optimised under [Shopify performance improvement recommendations](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/web-performance/improving-web-performance).

Since images can become significant bottleneck for website performance, all images must comply with [Shopify image size guidelines](https://www.shopify.com/blog/image-sizes) for faster page load times.

### Call to action

Different call to action aspects are well built into the [Stockmart theme](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/stockmart/styles/modern/preview), however it is required to comply with [Shopify overall call to action recommendations](https://www.shopify.com/blog/17156160-7-inspiring-ecommerce-call-to-action-examples-and-why-they-work) as well. Three must have call to action features:

 1. offer certain discount for the first order in return for an email address
 2. allow some items to mark as "the last in stock" to build scarsity for the item
 3. use hero images and mark "the book of this week" or "best seller"

### Analytics Integration

Google Analytics account will be created and tracking ID must be added to the website according to the Shopify [guidelines](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/google-analytics/google-analytics-setup). 

Enhanced e-commerce setup is required:
 - "Enhanced E-commerce Reporting" enabled in Google Analytics
 - proper "thank-you" page is designed and that the checkout is configured to support enhanced e-commerce data, such as product impressions, add-to-cart actions, and purchase data
 - goals in Google Analytics must be set to track critical actions like newsletter signups, completed purchases, account creations
 - funnel visualization to track where customers drop off during the checkout process must be set
 - Google Tag Manager (GTM) account must be created and container code added to Shoppify online store themes actions. GTM will be used to manage and deploy various tags without modifying the codebase directly - marketing pixels, heatmaps, and more advanced analytics scripts

### Secure and Trustworthy

Custom bookstore domain will be used and transfered to Shopify. Secure connection must be enabled at all times as of Shopify [guidelines](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/domains/managing-domains/secure-connections).
