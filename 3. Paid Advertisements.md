# Paid advertisments

## Budget Planning:
-   Since we will be using Shopify for our website, it makes sense to use the ads tool Shopify offers.
-   Shopify offers direct links to your storefront from facebook and instagram.
-   Shopify has a free first month trial, then the second month is 1 GBP and then the plan for small businesses is 49 GBP per month, which allows us to link our ads to our store front.
-   Ads are bought similarly in META and in Shopify - they are based on bids.
-   The smallest possible budget for META ads (In ad manager) and on Shopify could be 10-15 GBP per day in both META and Shopify. Monitoring the ads performance daily, weekly and monthly.
-   Total budget - 50 for Shopify and approx. 30 GBP per week for ads in META/Shopify store (incl., tiktok).

## Ad Creation:
-   Tailor ads to reflect the genres and types of books your target audience prefers. For example, create different ads for fiction readers, non-fiction readers, and young adult readers.
-   Use concise, engaging headlines that immediately capture attention in ad copies and create a sense of urgency and excitement, for example, “Join an exclusive online book club!”’, “Enemies to lovers trope? We got it all”, “Biggest book sale you have seen!” etc.
-   Use call-to-action (CTA) phrases like Join now!, Shop now!, Don't miss out! etc.
-   Visuals are the most important part - Use high-resolution images of book covers, reading spaces, or thematic imagery related to books. Ensure visuals are clear, appealing, and directly related to the ad copy!

## Targeting:

-   Age 24-35, who are more likely to be readers and engage with online content.
-   In the UK area and Europe.

-   Use behavioral targeting - users who shop online or shop specifically books online, users who have an average of above average usage time on the platform, active users who participate in commenting, liking, following etc.
-   META provides automatic placement of ads.
-   Use keywords: Pick 3-5 keywords that describe content well, for example, UK books, Steven King books online, crime thriller books, romance books, UK best-selling books, online book shopping (same principle as SEO).

## A/B Testing:
-   Test 2 or 3 visuals. Keep the same text but change the visual for each iteration.
-   Test each visual for at least 2 days.
-   Monitor performance and traffic over the set amount of days. Visuals that generate the most traffic have the most impact and should be used for longer ad campaigns.
-   Adjust visuals and ads based on A/B test performance.
