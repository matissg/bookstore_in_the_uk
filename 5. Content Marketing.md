### Content Strategy
 - Create customer personas for tailored content, taking into account statistics, for example,
	 - on average women are more active readers
	 - most active readers are between the ages of 25-34
	 - best selling genres are romance, mystery/ thriller, fantasy
 - Create social network profiles (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, Youtube, etc.) and use them *to communicate, make recommendations, publish fun statistics, best-selling book lists,  announcements of newest available books etc.*
 - Create a blog on the website, publish at least 1 blog post in a week - *book reviews, best-selling books, new releases overview*
 - Collaborations with authors and book reviewers
 - Film and publish *interviews with authors, children's book readings* in Youtube etc.
 - Interaction with readers is encouraged using *polls, quizzes, and reposting reader reader-created content*

### Quality Content
 - Used images and videos should be high quality and professionally edited
 - Within brand design guidelines (color scheme, logo, slogan etc.)
 - Following each social media recommended size in pixels and aspect ratio
 - Texts should be proofread
 - Content is positive, friendly, and polite in tone

### SEO Integration
 - All social media profiles must have the same profile picture, description, and link to the website - to increase brand recognition
 - Use keywords within text and hashtags
 - Post regularly, engage with users
 - Use recommended guidelines for blog posts too - title, description, heading use, image size and alt text etc.

### Content Distribution
 - Use a social media manager like Metricool, that offers additional functionality:
	 - planning and distributing all content in one place
	 - responding to comments and messages in one place
	 - Google and Facebook ads management
	 - content performance analysis
	 - competitor brand performance analysis
 - E-mail marketing to send out newsletters with the newest book additions etc.
 - Collaborations with authors and book reviewers for shared content

### Repurposing Content
 - Created content is re-used across different platforms using social media manager (facilitate different size and aspect ratio requirements)
 - Fragments of blog posts are used within social media content
 - Create fun infographics from blog post content for social media
