# Social media marketing

## Platform Selection:
-   According to previous research the average gender and age traffic to UK bookstores is predominantly female, more often, around the ages of 25-34.
-   Because of this demographic and its average age, I would choose the following platforms for marketing (based on data discussed here: [https://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-media-demographics/](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-media-demographics/)).
-   Facebook (META) - around 3 billion active users, 44% female audience, largest user age group: 25-34. Facebook was also the second most searched social media platform in the UK in 2023 ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/284506/united-kingdom-social-network-penetration/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/284506/united-kingdom-social-network-penetration/)).
-   Instagram (META) - around 2 billion active users, 48% female audience, largest user group: 18-39 (32%).
-   TikTok - 1.7 billion active users, 49% female audience, 35% of users in age group 18-29. More time spent on TikTok than any other platform.

## Content Calendar:
-   Define the goals of you content:
-   Engagement: Set clear goals - Increase interactions with your audience through likes, comments, and shares of your posts.
-   Brand Awareness: Enhance visibility and recognition of your bookstore and website.
-   Traffic: Drive traffic to your website.
-   Sales: Drive sales from your website and online store.
-   Define your content theme - books, literature, reading, reading in the UK, hobbies, relatable bookworms.
-   Choose a customizable layout that can be collaborative - e.g., excel, miro, google sheets etc.
-   Create a daily, weekly, monthly breakdown of posts. Post at least 1-2 a day to remain relevant.
-   In the calendar - define date, time of day, platform, content type ( instagram photo, instagram reel, facebook post etc.), description, hashtags, related books (books mentioned in the content (author and title)).
    
## Engagement:
-   Aim to respond to comments and messages within a set time frame (e.g., max 2 hours).
-   Address your followers by their names/handles and personalize your responses to make them feel valued. Be mindful of used pronouns.
-   Always respond positively, even to negative comments.
-   Run contests and giveaways to boost engagement and attract new followers.
-   Foster a Community - Host online book clubs and events (e.g., broadcasts, live streams etc.) where followers can participate and discuss different books.
 
## Influencer Partnerships:
-   Choose influencers who share content related to books, reading, and literature. Make sure they are relevant to our brand domain.
-   Ensure your chosen influencer followers match your target demographic (female, 25-34).
-   It is best to choose influencers with higher engagement rates rather than more followers.
-   Offer clear instructions on deliverables, deadlines, and content requirements.
-   Actively engage with the post influencer makes about your site and with the comments under that post.
 
## Analytics:
-   Use Facebook Insights, Instagram Insights, TikTok insights to gather in-app analytics on your platformâ€™s performance.
-   Use Google-analytics for a more in-depth comparison of competitors and our brand traffic.
-   Similarweb.com can also be used to compare website traffic and engagement.
-   Review weekly and monthly results. Adjust short-term marketing goals accordingly.
-   Review social media marketing strategy at least once every quarter based on analytics results.
