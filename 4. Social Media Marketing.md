## Platform Selection:
-   According to previous research the average gender and age traffic to UK bookstores is predominantly female, more often, around the ages of 25-34.
-   Because of this demographic and its average age, we choose the following platforms for marketing (also based on data discussed here: [https://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-media-demographics/](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-media-demographics/)).
-   Facebook (META) - around 3 billion active users, 44% female audience, largest user age group: 25-34.
